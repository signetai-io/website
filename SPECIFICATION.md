# Signet Protocol Specification (v0.2.5)
**Draft-Song-Signet-Neural-Lens-02.5**

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the Signet Protocol, a standard for attaching cryptographic proof of reasoning (VPR) to AI-generated content, aligned with **C2PA 2.3**.

## 2. Global Identity Registry (TrustKey Service)
To ensure the accountability of the 8 billion human curators, the protocol mandates a centralized settlement layer for Identity-to-Key binding.

### 2.1 Identity Uniqueness
- **Format**: All identities MUST follow the `[a-z0-9.].signet` format.
- **Uniqueness**: The Registry (Database Layer) MUST enforce a "First-to-Claim" policy. Once an identity is committed to the registry, its Ed25519 Public Key is permanently bound.
- **Collision Resistance**: Registration attempts for existing document IDs MUST be rejected by the node.

### 2.2 Public Key Lookup
- All Signet nodes MUST provide a public lookup endpoint: `GET /registry/lookup/{identity}`.
- Responses MUST return the associated 256-bit Public Key or a 404 error if unregistered.

## 3. Cryptographic Requirements
- **Algorithm**: MUST use Ed25519 for all signatures.
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 MUST be used for generating input/output content hashes.
- **Key Storage**: Keys generated by the TrustKeyService SHOULD be stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or TEEs.

## 4. The X-Signet-VPR Header
All Signet-compliant API responses MUST include the `X-Signet-VPR` header. This header contains a base64-encoded JSON object representing the signature chain.

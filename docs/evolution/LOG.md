# Signet AI Evolution Log

## Entry 01: The Transition to Protocol
**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Task Goal:** Transition from `aivoicecast.com` (Application Collection) to `signetai.io` (Protocol Ecosystem). Initialize the Verification Badge logic.

**Reasoning Path:**  
The pivot represents a move from "Software as a Service" to "Trust as a Service." By establishing the Signet Protocol (VPR), we ensure that every AI asset produced across the 20+ sub-apps is cryptographically verifiable. The "Verification Badge" acts as the first visual proof of this accountability on the landing page.

**Verification Check:**  
Symbolic Parity Check (Internal Neural Lens):
- Protocol Version: 0.2
- VPR Compliance: The badge logic correctly references Section 3 (Layer 4) of the technical specification.
- Identity Binding: The UI components are now keyed to the SignetAI namespace.

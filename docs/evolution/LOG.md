## Entry 09: C2PA-Signet Hybrid Standard
**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Task Goal:** Integrated C2PA-Signet Hybrid Standard and published VPR JSON Schema (`org.signetai.vpr`).

## Entry 10: Phase 1.5 - C2PA-Native Realignment
**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Task Goal:** Pivoted to 100% C2PA-Native architecture. Neural Prism now acts as a Cognitive Assertion Provider for Content Credentials.

**Reasoning Path:**  
Proprietary protocols create silos. By mapping our VPR logic directly into the C2PA JUMBF structure, Signet-verified assets become instantly readable by any C2PA-compliant validator (Adobe, Microsoft, etc.), while maintaining the unique depth of our "Cognitive Provenance."

**Verification Check:**  
- Manifest Structure: ISO/IEC 19566-5 (JUMBF) compliance verified.
- Terminology: "Vision Substrate" mapped to "Parent Ingredient".
- Tooling: `c2patool` integration examples verified for L3-L4 assertions.
